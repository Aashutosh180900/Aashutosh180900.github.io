Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

Some of the work have been correctly implemented in the project. Those include the use of HTML, CSS for styling and Java scripts to make use of functions throughout the website.
In the project, i made use of tables to design the unit outline in my own method, with the respective headings and subheadings whilst narrating the content. 
Styling in CSS was implemented to design the font size, types and colors except for some headings that have not worked.  
Lastly, i made use of java script to enable my 'dark mode' option. 

Some malfunctions in the project have been identified from the website validator W3C with 5 errors and including 1 fatal error as attached in the miscellenous folder.
