					will include an embedded image and link to each site critiqued. See the assignment handout for more
					information.
				</td>
				<br>
				<td>Web Applications: This is a take-home assessment. You will implement a simple website using the web
					technologies and design principles discussed throughout the semester. See the assignment handout for
					more information.

				</td>
				<br>
				<td>Extended Learning Portfolio: This assessment is a portfolio of your work during the semester plus an
					additional task(s). You present a reflective, coherent account of the achievements and demonstrate
					an understanding of the ULO evidenced by your work during the semester. You can improve on earlier
					work and incorporate any feedback you have received during the semester before submitting the
					portfolio. The portfolio is due during the examination period.

				<h3>Assessment Moderation</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Fair assessment through moderation</h4>
			</div>
			<div>
				Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the
				learning outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for
				the moderation of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available
				from
				<a href="javascript:void(0)">policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Pre-marking moderation</h4>
				A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and
				monitor and confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the
				assessment task, marking criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking
				guides/rubrics and sufficient information to ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h4>
				The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:
				<br>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries
				<br>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where
				students have not met the pass requirements
				<br>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations
				<br>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and
				standards
			</div>

			<div>
				<h4>Late assessment</h4>
				Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in
				this unit.
				Where a late assessment is permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the
				Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment
				extension:

				<br>1. For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will
				be
				penalised by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;
				<br>2. For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks
				allocated for the assessment item will be deducted; and
				<br>3. Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of
				zero.
				<br>Where late assessment is <b>NOT</b> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit
				(refer to the
				Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment
				extension:
				<br>1. All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.

			<div>
				<h4>Where an application for an assessment extension is permitted for an assessment item(s) within this
					unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</h4>
			</div>
			<div>
				1. A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of
				exceptional circumstances beyond the student’s control, may apply for an assessment extension on the
				Assessment Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on
				the Forms page at
				<a href="javascript:void(0)">https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms//</a>
				and also within the
				student's OASIS (My Studies tab – Quick Forms) account.
				<br>2. The student will be expected to submit their application for an Assessment Extension with
				supporting
				documentation
				<a href="javascript:void(0)">via the online form.</a>
				<br>3. Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are
				declined, delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.
				<br>4. An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment
				item
				where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the
				application prior to the assessment due date/time
			</div>
			<div>
				Where an application for an assessment extension is <b>NOT</b> permitted for an assessment item(s)
				within this
				unit (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):

				1. All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will be subject to late penalties or receive a
				mark of zero depending on the unit permitting late assessment submissions.

			</div>

			<div>
				<h4>Deferred assessments</h4>
				If your results show that you have been granted a deferred assessment you should immediately check OASIS
				for details.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Further assessments</h4>
				Further assessments, if granted by the Board of Examiners, will be held between 13/07/2022 and
				22/07/2022 . Notification to students will be made after the Board of Examiners meeting via the Official
				Communications Channel in OASIS.
				<br>
				It is the responsibility of the student to be available to complete the requirements of a further
				assessment. If your results show that you have been granted a further assessment you should immediately
				check OASIS for details.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities/health circumstances likely to impact on
					studies</h4>
				A <a href="javascript:void(0)">Curtin Access Plan</a> (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and
				level of support required by a
				student with a disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin.
				Carers for people with disability may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative
				exam or test arrangements, study materials in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and
				services or other support as discussed with an advisor from <a href="javascript:void(0)">AccessAbility
					Services.</a>
				<br>
				Documentation is required from your treating Health Professional to confirm your health circumstances or
				carer responsibilities.
				<br>
				If you think you may be eligible for a CAP, please contact AccessAbility Services. If you already have a
				CAP please provide it to the Unit Coordinator in week 1 of each study period.
